# INTERN-PROJECT
The Smart Lending : Identifying  home loan borrowers through optimized random forest model successfully identifies key factors that influence loan approval, such as age, gender, employment type, and salary range. A Random Forest Classifier was used to predict loan approval, with a strong performance shown through high accuracy and effective classification.
The model highlights salary range and employment type as the most influential factors in determining loan approval. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning ensured the model's reliability and minimized overfitting. These insights can help optimize loan approval processes and improve targeted marketing strategies for potential loan applicants.
